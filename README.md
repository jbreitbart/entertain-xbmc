XBMC T-Entertain Plugin
=======================

About
-----

The XBMC Entertain Plugin integrates live TV streaming via [Deutsche Telekom's
Entertain] [1] IPTV service into XBMC. This plugin is useful for occasional live
TV viewing. If you require power features like time shift viewing or recording,
you should consider installing a TV backend server like tvheadend, vdf or
dvbviewer. It allows to view all german public channels (Ã–ffentlich-Rechtliche
Sender) and some of the commercial channels (RTL Group) in XBMC.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need a german DSL/VDSL Entertain contract from Deutsche Telekom and a router
supporting IPTV via multicast proxying in order to use this service (you have
one, if you use the one you got from Deutsche Telekom)! See
